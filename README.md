- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @RyanBuzar
- üì´ How to reach me: my SeattleU email or Linkedin.com/in/ryanbuzar/
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on Classroom Projects and other personal projects to enhance my portfolio and learn / reinforce new concepts and tecnologies. 
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in careers in Data Science, Data engineering, Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Programming. I really enjoy the challenge of being faced with a business problem and being able to work collaboratively to think through the problem, come up with a solution, implement and test the solution, and deliver the solution to the customer. That 'delight' when we've delivered what the customer was asking for is what keeps me coming back! I love to deliver programs that are complete, and if we have time, add in those extra features that make a solution just a little bit easier for a customer. I'm very passionate about continuous improvement, I believe one of the worst things in business you can say are "Well, that's how we've always done it." There is something to be said for solutions that work, but being able to take a step back and asking "How can we do it better?" is sometimes an important part of innovation and organizational transformation. We have to be nimble and flexible in today's fast-paced world.
  
- In my free time when I'm not studying or working I enjoy Cycling, Triathlon, Hiking, Swimming, Running, Capming, Tinkering with Cars (I was a BMW Master Technician for a number of years), Computers, Video Games, Going to the Shooting Range, Working on various projects around the house, Playing with our THREE dogs (you read that correctly!), and spending time with my wife and two children.
